    "question": "what is c language?",
    "answer": "C is a high-level programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is known for its efficiency and is often used for system programming, developing operating systems, and creating applications that require high performance. Key features of the C language include:\n\n1. **Procedural Language**: C follows a procedural programming paradigm, which means it focuses on functions or procedures to operate on data.\n\n2. **Low-Level Access**: C provides low-level access to memory through the use of pointers, which allows for manipulation of hardware and memory resources directly.\n\n3. **Portability**: Programs written in C can be easily moved from one platform to another with minimal changes, making it a versatile choice across different systems.\n\n4. **Rich Set of Operators**: C supports a variety of operators, including arithmetic, logical, relational, and bitwise operators.\n\n5. **Standard Library**: C includes a comprehensive set of built-in functions and libraries that facilitate operations such as file handling, string manipulation, and mathematical computation.\n\n6. **Modularity**: C supports the creation of modular programs by enabling the division of code into functions and files.\n\n7. **Typeless Language**: While C is strongly typed (meaning variables must be declared with specific types), it offers a level of flexibility when it comes to type casting.\n\n8. **Influential**: C has influenced many other programming languages, including C++, C#, Java, and more, making it foundational in the development of computer programming.\n\nOverall, C is praised for its performance, control, and flexibility, and it continues to be widely used in various applications, from embedded systems to high-level application development."
